# 4 Corners Probe
Adds new PathPilot probing tab "Corner Probes" and hotkeys to probe NW, SW, NE or SE corner. You must be on the Probing screen.

<b>Keyboard Shortcuts:</b>

F9 = North West Corner<br>
F10 = North East Corner<br>
F11 = South East Corner<br>
F12 = South West Corner (Default PP corner probing)<br>

This will not change the default SW corner probing routine found on the PathPilot X/Y/Z Probe tab.  These routines work exactly like the default PathPilot corner probe routine in that you need to have your probe tip positioned less than .750 away from the corner in both x and y. The PathPilot version number in the lower right hand corner of the screen will read V1.9.13-SA

Also adds new buttons to change WCS.  Note: There wasnt much room to put "G" on the buttons.  So, button 54 is G54, etc.

<b>Installation</b>

Download zip and extract to USB drive
While on PathPilot screen, press CRTL+ALT+X to bring up terminal window
In the terminal window type in NAUTILUS and press ENTER
Copy the v1.9.13 folder from the usb drive to the HOME FOLDER
Merge All and Replace All when prompted
ALT+TAB to cycle back to PathPilot and restart
You should now see "V1.9.13-SA" in the lower right.

<b>DISCLAIMER:</b> Use at your own risk. After installing you should test each probing routine with your probe far away from any part. Use your finger to trigger the probe.  Also, cycle through each WCS button to ensure they are working correctly.

Note:  This update will probably be the last until PP 2.0 is release.
