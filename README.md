# 4 Corners Probe
Add PathPilot hotkeys to probe NW, SW, NE or SE corner.  You must be on the Probing screen, then press one of the following keys.

F9 = North West Corner<br>
F10 = North East Corner<br>
F11 = South East Corner<br>
F12 = South West Corner (Default PP corner probing)<br>

This will not change the default SW corner probing routine found on the PathPilot probing page.  These routines work exactly like the default PathPilot corner probe routine in that you need to have your probe tip positioned less than .750 away from the corner in both x and y. The PathPilot version number in the lower right hand corner of the screen will read V1.9.13-SA

<b>Installation</b><br>

Download zip and extract to USB drive<br>
While on PathPilot screen, press CRTL+ALT+X to bring up terminal window<br>
In the terminal window type in NAUTILUS and press ENTER<br>
Copy the v1.9.13 folder from the usb drive to the HOME FOLDER<br>
Merge All and Replace All when prompted<br>
ALT+TAB to cycle back to PathPilot and restart<br>
You should now see "V1.9.13-SA" in the lower right.<br>

<b>DISCLAIMER</b>:  Use at your own risk.  After installing you should test each routine with your probe far away from any part.  Use your finger to trigger the probe.
