# 4_Corners_Probe
Add PathPilot hotkeys to probe NW, SW, NE or SE corner.  You must be on the Probing screen, then press one of the following keys.

F9 = NW Corner<br>
F10 = SW Corner<br>
F11 = NE Corner<br>
F12 = SE Corner<br>

This will not change the default SW corner probing routine found on the PathPilot probing page.

DISCLAIMER:  Use at your own risk.  After installing you should test each routine with your probe far away from any part.  Use your finger to trigger the probe.
