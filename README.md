# 4_Corners_Probe
Add PathPilot hotkeys to probe NW, SW, NE or SE corner.  You must be on the Probing screen, then press one of the following keys.

F9 = NW Corner
F10 = SW Corner
F11 = NE Corner
F12 = SE Corner

This will not change the default SW corner probing routine found on the PathPilot probing page.
